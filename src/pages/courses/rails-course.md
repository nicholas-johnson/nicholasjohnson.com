**Rails is the highly productive rapid prototyping framework used by startups the world over. Learn Rails from someone who has actually used it commercially for many years. Live coding, Q&A, practical workshops, deep theory, real world exercises and code reviews.**

Get your work done in double quick time. Publish websites, APIs, web applications and mobile applications using an agile, friendly framework.

Involve yourself in one of the happiest communities on the Internet. Use MVC to keep everything where it should be, a place for everything and everything in it's place. We will use no Powerpoint, demos will involve adaptive live coding, Q&A and reference material to review and take away. Exercises are practical and become increasingly open ended as the course progresses.

The course can be fully tailored to the needs of the individual client, and even the individual codebase. Courses can range from 3 to 5 days and because there's no middleman cost as little as Â£3100 + VAT.

Courses can run at your offices anywhere in the world, or out of a bright and shiney Brighton based training venue.
