**Learn Angular from someone who actually uses it. Live coding, Q&A, practical workshops, deep theory, real world exercises and code reviews.**

I have taught Angular courses to hundreds of clients all over the UK and the world. Because I know and use the material, each course can be bespoke. We will use no Powerpoint, Demos will involve adaptive live coding, Q&A and reference material to review and take away. Exercises are practical and become increasingly open ended as the course progresses.

The course can be fully tailored to the needs of the individual client, even on the fly. Courses can range from 3 to 5 days and because there's no middleman cost as little as Â£3100 + VAT.
