# Matrix Maths (Fundamentals of Linear Algebra)

The great thing about matrices is that they contain a bunch of elements that are predictably all the same as each other. This makes them ideal for parallel processing. We use GPUs (sometimes called TPUs or Tensor Processing Units) to load a load of data all at once, then CHUNK, we process all that data at the same time.
