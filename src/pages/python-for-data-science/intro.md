# Python is a lovely language

It's also the language of machine learning, so it makes a lot of sense to learn it.

Python is a high level, interpreted language that emphasises beauty and readability. It's easy to learn, nice and uncluttered to l

## The Zen of Python

1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
2. Explicit is better than implicit.
3. Simple is better than complex.
4. Complex is better than complicated.
5. Flat is better than nested.
6. Sparse is better than dense.
7. Readability counts.
8. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
9. Although practicality beats purity.
10. Errors should never pass silently.
11. Unless explicitly silenced.
12. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
13. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
14. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
15. Now is better than never.
16. Although never is often better than _right_ now.
17. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
18. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
19. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

<!-- 1. Look at Python builtins and builtins classes.
2. Understand the object class and the basis of object orientated programming,
3. Understand then the text classes (unicode string, byte string and bytearray),
4. Numeric classes (integer, boolean, floating point and complex),
5. then the builtins collections (tuple, list, frozenset, set and dictionary).
6. Make sure you are also comfortable with code blocks (if, elif, else and for and while loops).
7. Then the collections and itertools module are good to learn as they are closely associated with builtins and reinforce some of the concepts and have good documentation.

8. Then learn the math, random, datetime and statistics module and the mathematic principal behind the functions in these modules. These functions operate on scalars. Understanding these makes it easier to work with numpy which generally assumes you know these functions and broadcasts these to ndarrays which is a fundamental numeric data structure.

9. Once comfortable with numpy, learn pandas which is based around a DataFrame which is essentially an Excel worksheet. Each Series has a column name and associated ndarray.

10. Then learn matplotlib, you already have some basics here but get comfortable with the functional and object orientated programming syntax.

11. Seaborn is also a good library to learn it is a data visualisation library based around matplotlib.

12. Once comfortable with the above, you can move onto something more advanced like scikit learn.
