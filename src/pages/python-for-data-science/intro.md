1. Look at Python builtins and builtins classes.
2. Understand the object class and the basis of object orientated programming,
3. Understand then the text classes (unicode string, byte string and bytearray),
4. Numeric classes (integer, boolean, floating point and complex),
5. then the builtins collections (tuple, list, frozenset, set and dictionary).
6. Make sure you are also comfortable with code blocks (if, elif, else and for and while loops).
7. Then the collections and itertools module are good to learn as they are closely associated with builtins and reinforce some of the concepts and have good documentation.

8. Then learn the math, random, datetime and statistics module and the mathematic principal behind the functions in these modules. These functions operate on scalars. Understanding these makes it easier to work with numpy which generally assumes you know these functions and broadcasts these to ndarrays which is a fundamental numeric data structure.

9. Once comfortable with numpy, learn pandas which is based around a DataFrame which is essentially an Excel worksheet. Each Series has a column name and associated ndarray.

10. Then learn matplotlib, you already have some basics here but get comfortable with the functional and object orientated programming syntax.

11. Seaborn is also a good library to learn it is a data visualisation library based around matplotlib.

12. Once comfortable with the above, you can move onto something more advanced like scikit learn.

## What is Pytorch and why is is good?

Pytorch is a framework for machine learning. Made by Meta, it has quickly become the tool of choice for machine learning professionals, taking over from Google's TensorFlow
