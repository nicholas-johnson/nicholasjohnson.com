# Training a Perceptron

When I was at university, one of the first tasks we did with neural networks was building logic gates. You can think of it

## NOT gate

A not gate takes a Boolean value and gives the opposite. A one yields a zero and vice versa. We can represent it using the following truth table:

| input | output
| 1 | 0
| 0 | 1
