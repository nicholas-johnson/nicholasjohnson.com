    <h1>Ruby</h1>
    <p>
      I first encountered Ruby back when Rails first came out in 2005. Prior to
      that I had been doing most of my work in PHP, and like a lot of people, I
      was utterly blown away by how easy it was to get something going.
    </p>

    <p>
      Later I went on to build StreetBank.com, a social enterprise that did
      quite well for a few years back before Facebook Marketplace was a thing.
      We aimed to put neighbours in touch with each other to share things,
      skills and friendship.

    <h1>The Ruby Course</h1>

    <p>
      I originally built the Ruby course back in 2015 for a client called Deaf
      Alerter, who make fire alarms for deaf people, then later went on to
      deliver it to several dozen larger clients internationally. The material
      is available here, you're welcome to make any use of it you wish.
